And the sun appeared a little peculiar. Or at least the way it made the grass look. Maybe itï¿½s rising earlier these days, the sun. Itï¿½s hard to tell, really, but in any case it was all white and clear and it filled the landscape with an eerie sort of holiness that was remarkable in comparison to impressionist pieces. The texture of that moment was probably ruined, or at least wasted, because my driver insisted on using the air-conditioner. A thousand curses on him. I pay him, after all. So I was inclined to be content with whatever decision he made about fresh or processed air, much like my butlerï¿½s decisions with fresh or processed vegetables. It doesnï¿½t really matter to me that much, but somehow things that are fresh seem to make me feel like a real man. I donï¿½t know. I guess it doesnï¿½t really matter in the end. Bah.</p> <p>So we went with the cold air that morning, and as we were gliding in a black and glossy purr along the avenue, we crossed down into a residential street where I saw an old man standing at the foot of his driveway. I suppose it wasnï¿½t too strange, Florida being populated with elderly people like a dog is populated with fleas, but somehow this moved me. We drove past, and I noticed the way he stood there with his hands on his hips, sort of staring down the street. He had on a colorless jumpsuit with a belt and a mesh hat that fit poorly on his soft and feeble head. I wondered what he was staring at. Or after. Had someone just left his house? Or perhaps his son was coming to visit? Maybe he was waiting for the mail, or for the Lord to come again. He wasnï¿½t smiling or frowning at all. I wondered if he even meant to be outside. I wondered what color life becomes when you grow old. I wondered if maybe the verve of life would be smothered with age, or perhaps it burns brighter as a string of bulbs on the coming of night. It caused a sadness to fill up in me, and he never did look up. But lo, soon we arrived at the deli, and it was time for me to do the errands.</p> <span class=article__dagger>◆</span> </article> </main> </body> </html>
