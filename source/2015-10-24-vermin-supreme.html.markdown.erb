**I was slouching at the bus stop** in front of the state capital when an old dude flopped on the bench next to me and started narrating what he saw to himself in a husky southern drawl, quiety, under his breath. He said: “So many birds!” as a hundred or more flew overhead in a soft patter of wings. “I’ve lived here nearly all my life and...and still what a day!" I looked over. He had bucked teeth, like a wild rodent, and cowboy stubble, and a tucked-in denim shirt. His legs were crossed like two noodles and his hair drifted around like wisps over a soup bowl. His eyes browsed the street scene. Two trailing birds flew overhead. "Look! There are two of em!"

The crosswalk sign flashed and the man made of brilliant white LEDs morphed into numbers counting down. “8, 7, 6” the guy said, following the numbers one step behind. He counted all the way down to zero until the red hand appeared, flashing. Having come to the conclusion of this little story, he looked out again over the street, seemingly pleased with how it had concluded. He turned to me: “I’ve been on the 5th floor of that building."

Did you know there's someone running for president named "Vermin Supreme?" And that we wears a boot on his head?
