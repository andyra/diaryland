**The weather outside was all mild and tropical** and I left for a neighborhood run at dusk. It has been good to run this summer, to sweat like a roasting pig in the still hot heat of a rainy evening. It does something good in the middle of what is turning out to be a particularly long, hard case of the blues. Houses in this rain look inviting with their living rooms filled with furniture, and with the glow of refrigerators opening and closing as supper is prepared.

**Later, at Target**, I browsed for a machine to maintain my nose hair and overheard a group of four college dudes talking in excited voices about grooming products. They talked about aftershave and pretended to puke when they smelt it. One of them said **I use Irish Spring and it is so dope!**

Now, let's see what this nose hair trimmer can do.
