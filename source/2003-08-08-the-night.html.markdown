_an imaginary essay written by air-conditioner_

**It is the night** that fills in the marshes of the sun, the night that comes in streams and circles into the deep planet, green and dark, that imbues the crests of creation with dream. The day has its specific charm noted infrequently in its transient passage through the white morning curtains, but if truth is to be told, it is only at night when the verve of life comes out of the water and enjoys a beverage beside the pool. It begins as you step through the door, out of the wicker house. There it is.

It is there as it has always been there. It is a lonesome miser who lives in the company of yellow newspaper, televisions, iodine bottles, who sits on furniture and gazes out the window as you and your sister throw the cat into the sprinkler. It doesnï¿½t disguise itself otherwise, content to remain the antique liquid-breeze that hangs from lamp-posts and skyscrapers, the magnolia trees. It is the cloud that has passed in its sleep, the dew that has not yet lived, the acrid breath mint of the honeysuckle plant. It seldom moves but in sleepy pulls and heaves, reeling in slow-motion like a sweet-sick drunk as it stirs the insects from their suspended places and moves them, along with seeds, around parked cars and into window panes, gently.

The way night moves around a sleeping boy,

soft,

static,

dream,

under a canopy in heaven.
