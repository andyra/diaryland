**Put your ear down to the plate**, listen to the sound of the queen precipitate, tears the size of candy cars, eyes the size of neutron stars. Daddy wants a piece of deceadent german chocolate cake, so GIVE IT TO HIM MAMA, don't make him wait. It's a birthday treat for the cabin and crew, stayig out to break curfew. Now dig those ponies with the long long hair, talkin trash in their underwear. Cook a meal and eat it twice, Â Eat the cheese throw out the rice. Watermelon matchcar spirit zoo. Lemon, blindfold, cowsaymoo. Asbestos, lead, and mercury too.
