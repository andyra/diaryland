**It was not altogether Danny's fault** that the infamous Winchester Nine had settled in his house. He just remembered waking up that morning to the sound of silverwares and tea cups clincking wealthily in the parlor area. As he put on his glasses and removed his sleeping Cinta from his head, he could have sworn he heard the muffled sound of men speaking about grocery shopping. "Grocery shopping," thought Danny, "that's what I forgot to put on my 'to-do' list yesterday." But it was too late for that now; he had mysterious figures sitting in the parlor sipping tea and discussing the rising and falling price of vegetables. Mysterious figures wearing black cloaks, swarthy burlap robes, and grim weapons strapped with blackened leather to their sides; Danny knew this because he was now standing in the middle of the floor, confused at the appearance of the Nine men. A stray thunder cloud sounded ominously from the rain on the horizon.

"So hey. What's up, guys?" said Danny quite smoothly, considering. The clatter of the teacups ceased as did the horrible muttering that issued from the monstrously wrinkled faces. There were 17 shiny, beady eyes directed at Danny in all of his yellow bathrobed splendor. A lune from the neighboring rainforest gave a lonesome cry that could be heard, if ever so imperceptibly, from the parlor of Danny's house. The infamous Winchester Nine, serial killers and plunderers, all rose from the lacey graves of their chiffon-laden ottomans and put their teacups on the floor. Silently.

"**All hail Danny, Princess of America!**" they proclaimed in a grim and fierce voice that sounded as one. Danny remained in his place with his hands resting in the nestles of his bathrobe pockets. He adjusted his glasses and then he scratched his head. Surely this could not be reality. Perhaps he was dreaming yet. The Winchester Nine still stood facing him with unreasonably cold and unfriendly faces and their hands in a saluted position. As it turns out, it was reality and Danny was made the supervisor of the rotten criminal gang which eventually lead to his becoming the godfather of the entire French mafia which in turn lead to his untimely demise as a French aristocrat.

The rain came slowly at first, and then it gradually increased to hurricane-like proportions.
