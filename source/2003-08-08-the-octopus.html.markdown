**a voice:** though the scene is alive, all is silent and sleeping.

**narrator:** an enormous crowd is gathered in the streets of a slum in central miami. children and adults fill the streets, all in rags. burlap rags. a smoke screen hovers over the masses. an office building looks down. signs of protest. the throng becomes ravenous. the crowd becomes violent. they pump their fists into the black sky and scream with words that no man can hear. all is hush.

**a voice:** slowly, slowly the sound of laughter arises. it is not normal laughter, but irritating laughter, like that kind of laugh that someone makes when he has no confidence in his own humor. the sounds of static pink-noise fills up the theatre. timpani rolls. the house symphony swells in with a final deafening chord.

**narrator:** a microphone slowly descends from the stage as the curtains close. it is covered in a fuzzy wind screen. all is silent again. the cast comes out from either side of the stage and the curtains pull up again.

**a voice:** the octopus

**dr. scholls:** i am sitting here in a white chair in my sun-room. it is nearing evening. this is the setting.

**narrator:** dr. scholls sips on a frosty cup of iced tree. he is wearing yellow shorts and a white t-shirt with no sleeves. white hair is on his chest like steel-wool from heaven.

**the milkman:** good afternoon, dr. scholls. i have your order right here in my hands. what are you reading? it is a beautiful day.

**dr. scholls:** it will rain.

**the milkman:** i am wearing a white smock and a white cap that says milk in red letters. but it is such a beautiful day. what could happen?

**narrator:** both of the characters freeze and the light from the balcony is moved to a painted scene outside, where a young boy and a young girl are playing in a sprinkler. the grass is a most delicious shade of green. a falcon comes from the clouds and takes the little girl in his claws. her head is found many months later by the boy in a toy box covered with dried blood and chocolate syrup.

**the milkman:** i have been swimming today.

**old woman 1:** now we are at the house by the side of the road, where weary travelers let down their load. welcome, stranger.

**the guest:** we are in a house under the coming clouds. it is weather-beaten, but loved. several people converse cordially in the living area.

**old woman 1:** old woman 2, we have a new guest.

**old woman 2:** old woman 1 and old woman 2 are both dressed in the fashion of the old days, each carrying several layers of lip-stick on their faces. they smell of sweet perfume and soaps. their house has lace and wicker.

**knight:** welcome, weary traveler. unladen thine physique of burdens and metaphysical sorrows. here, let me pinch thee in the behind.

**narrator:** the night pinches the guest in the behind most prestigiously.

**old woman 1:** you are in luck, guest. we are having butt-cakes and hot tree for a change.

**fox:** i am a fox, and the old woman's pet. i helped aldous huxley write his book on contemporary literary criticism.

**a voice:** the rain clouds are coming over the horizon, and the sun is backed into the back of the theater stage. the wind picks up and synthesized wind comes whistling from the window panes. it grows dark outside.
(a cuban and the parish priest enter the doorway with sacks of snorkels and goggles)

**dr. scholls:** i have made an appointment with the hair parlor. they say he works wonders.

**ms. bells:** i have heard that nobody does a better job of cutting the hair than the parish priest himself!

**parish priest:** and here i am. with no scissors. they must be in my automobile.
(time passes slowly for delinquents. the excitement of the coming weekends dawns as the storm approaches)

**ms. apples:** milkman, may i hold your hand?

**milkman:** (flirt)

**ms. apples:** you give me too much credit. how agreeable your features are to me

**milkman:** (flirt)

**ms. apples:** may i hold your hand in mine?

**priest:** (whispering) walk away.

**narrator:** there is a sudden glorious harp frill that erupts from center stage. the entire cast is filled with awe and all begin to talk excitedly.

**cuban:** i am amazed at the sounds.

**milkman:** i feel thee in my soul.

**holy ghost:** can you see me?

**c.e.o:** and that was how i came to fall for the minstrel.

**boy:** my youth is a plague.

**girl:** your youth and mine.

**dr. scholls:** is that so? even my shoe-comforters could not fathom this.

**c.e.o:** your furniture resembles artifacts of ancient suburbia.

**the guest:** where are the butt-cakes and hot tree?

**milkman:** come here, my beautiful porpoise.

**ms. apples:** i am like a radiant beam.

**a voice:** the house is now underwater.

**narrator:** the sound of underwater submarines is heard all over the house. stephen segal, which is me, is now hovering from the rafters in a golfing uniform holding a microphone. the symphony keeps the beat of his heart with a timpani drum and a waterphone.

**boy:** i see the lights from the surface show very dimly here.

**girl:** yes.

**octopus:** it is not a bad life. meet my friends who live in this sea.

**narrator:** octopus, jellyfish, seahorse, shark.

**ms. apples:** i am aflame with lust. please direct me to the salad bar.

**milkman:** (flirt)

**octopus:** i will now dismember your soul in order to keep you silent.

**dr. scholls:** my liquid comforters keep every sole happy.

**narrator:** a white light erupts from the bottom of the ocean and all is white. the sounds of chirstmas carols being played backwards, marching armies, korg synthesizer, japanese keyboards, feedback, microphone hissing, and static-electricity from carpet feed slowly into the stage. suddenly,

**a voice:** men in white sheets like ghosts come tied to ropes from the ceiling and take all the mens' hats in the auditorium.

**narrator:** the sounds become louder. and louder. it is unbearable.

**boy:** (standing up from the ocean floor and pointing out to the audience) look. a drum.

**a voice:** nervous laughter swells up from back stage.
(the curtain closes and the symphony gives one last deafening chord before the entire audience begins to leave.)

**END**
