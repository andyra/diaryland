_( a foolproof screenplay by andy )_

**Setting**: Setting is late-July in a southern U.S. state. Time is Sunday, mid-afternoon.

~

**Voice A**: (softly) "I am the Narrator." (normally) "The actors and playwrights are scattered throughout a dimly lit theater, poised on the edge of the red velouran fold-up seats as if preparing to plunge into a hotel swimming pool. On the dark stage behind the curtains is the set of a lawn party. Actors and actresses are arranging themselves deftly around circular white tables under yellow and white striped umbrellas. The men and women are dressed shrewdly in crisp white suits and green dresses, washed out vests and laced-up skirts and top hats. Brazen ornamental fabrics adorn them all."

**Voice B**: (softy) "Open curtain."

**Voice A**: "As the curtain opens, a wash of natural sunlight fills the dusty auditorium. The playwrights and civilians filling the seats utter a hushed moan of bewilderment as they realize that the set is the actual out-doors, not a set."

**Voice B**: (very very loudly) "Enter triumphant musical swell!"

**Voice B**: (Beseechingly and again, very very loud) "A burst of glittering glissandos, chimes, sweeping cellos, conversation, and electronic synthesizer sounds comes startlingly from the pit!"

_[ A natural breeze filters lazily through the trees as the actors (posing as party guests) recline and enjoy their malted and lemoned beverages ]_

~

**Mr. Remington**: "The guests" conversation is a smeary hum of words, accompanied by much polite laughter and appreciative remarks. What a good party it is that I have put on."


**Ms. Thins**: (laughing) "How right you are, my beautiful concubine!"


**Mr. Remington**: "Excuse me, filthy woman, but I do not even know you. My wife, Helen invited you. I would appreciate it greatly if you would not refer to me in such vulgar terms."


**Ms. Thins**: "I will sit in the corner."

~

**Voice B**: (softly) "An actor dressed as a cinematographer descends stealthily from the elm tree, a cardboard camera in his hand. Nobody in the party seems to notice."


**James Yale**: "Did you hear about the acrobat who Mrs. Remington did hire for this outing?"


**Petunia**: "Oh, I did! He is supposed to be the finest in the South. They say he can spin dinner plates with his toes while he is airborne."


**Flower**: "I like acrobats."


**James Yale**: "It is my opinion that they are foolish. They perform tricks for the pleasure of others, which is what obedient horses do when their nature has gone from them."

~

**Voice A**: "At the table across from James Yale, Dr. Shipp is balancing a spoon on his nose; three attractive women laugh."

~

**Reverend Oats**: "In any case, brother Jackson, the first time I realized that my automobile was not ever going to work again, I purchased a fine black cigar and celebrated that day! It is amazing how simple life can be when you don"t have to go to the filling station or wash the windshield. What are your thoughts on this subject or what are your thoughts on the subject of political unrest?"

**Colonel Jackson**: "I do agree with your presuppositions and meanderings, Father Oats, but I can"t figure out why my iced tea tastes like watercolors!"

~

**Voice B**: (aggravatingly loud and nasal) "It is at this point that Colonel Jackson realizes his mistake in drinking out of his son's watercolor glass. Two women throw up their arms tragically as Colonel Jackson knocks a white table over in a gagging stupor. Dr. Dre struggles violently with his emotions. A strident clamour arises from the pit: timpani rolls and screeching violins accompany the clash of cymbals, buzzing tubas, and synthetic machine guns. Crescendo."

**Voice 1**: "Silence."

[ abrupt silence ]

**Voice A**: (speaking with artificial reverb, voice slowly diminishing) "The sound of the curtain dragging along the stage is the only audible noise as the sunlight is closed out forever from the already dreary auditorium. Hushed sounds of weeping are heard from the playwrights and suburbanites sitting in the red velouran fold-up seats."

**Voice B**: (softly) "Exit."

**END**
