**The Green Sunset is a smoothie** I get at Juice Land. It's the color of a canyon, mauve and orange and cherry red, with flecks of black vegetable, and I love it! Next to the register rests an opalescent crystal the size of a Nerf football. One of the juice-goons employed there once saw me looking at it and said something about how humans find crystals appealing because they express the ease with which nature generates beautiful morphologies and adapts to change. I didn't understand what he meant, but I appreciated the word "morphology." He had a pony tail.

 It rained on the way home, a little, and the smell of burgers was in the air.
