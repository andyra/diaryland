**I got a piece of chocolate cake in the afternoon**, on the bottom floor of an old-timey hotel downtown. It had a flake of real gold on it and it also cost $9 (which is a lot of money, if you ask me, for a bit of cake). I walked back in the sun to the office and ate it in front of the computer screen at work. I ate the flake of gold too. The coffee was gross smelled like the way my old car used to smell after a rain storm.

I learned that in 2014, a collosal statue was found in Egypt depicting Agamemnon III the Magnificent and  his wife, Tiye, seated side-by-side "with three of their daughters standing in front of the throneâ€”Henuttaneb, the largest and best preserved, in the centre; Nebetah on the right; and another, whose name is destroyed, on the left."
