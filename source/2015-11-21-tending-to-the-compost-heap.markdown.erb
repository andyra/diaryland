title: Tending to the Compost Heap

**Well I woke up early** and the dog through the backyard window was chewing on a hackberry branch. I [lay] in bed farting quietly into the sleeping bag / watching spiders float in diagonal lines over the compost pile when I found myself going down a road of unhappy thinking. So I rose, shampoo’d, and chased Henry throughout the great backyard with a bowl of apples and oatmeal in my hand. Henry reared horse-like on his hind legs, swinging the branch with his mouth like a medieval weapon of old [morning star].

On the way to Cherrywood, I came across a craft fair at an autumnal Presbyterian church built from [horizontal slabs of stone] . An elderly women in a [macrame] denim vest cooed sweet greetings to me as I entered, her eyes visible between the displays of bedazzled salad spoons and plastic jewelry. She showed me the bounty of the refreshment table, covered in [pumpkin rolls], lemon squares, monkey bread, and styrofoam cup coffee. A genteel big-haired woman from Lago Vista [woo’d] me to her table with [rich] descriptions of her scented candles. She explained she was more of a musk lady than a floral one. Couldn’t stand the scent of Jasmine. I liked Rocky Mountain Christmas and told her so.
