It had a flake of real gold on it and it also cost $9 (which is a lot of money, if you ask me, for a bit of cake). I walked back in the sun to the office and ate it in front of the computer screen at work. I ate the flake of gold too. The coffee was gross smelled like the way my old car used to smell after a rain storm.</p> <p>I learned that in 2014, a collosal statue was found in Egypt depicting Agamemnon III the Magnificent and his wife, Tiye, seated side-by-side “with three of their daughters standing in front of the throne—Henuttaneb, the largest and best preserved, in the centre; Nebetah on the right; and another, whose name is destroyed, on the left.”</p> <figure class="figure figure--full"><img class=figure__image width=634 height=390 src="/diaryland/assets/images/agamemnoniii-f87347eb.jpg"/></figure> <span class=article__dagger>◆</span> </article> </main> </body> </html>
