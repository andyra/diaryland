We were talking in the living room about whatever when it started to rain. This was a bad thing because it meant Gelber couldn’t leave yet. This was also a good thing because the house was full of cardboard boxes and bare floors and only me, and rain meant that Gelber couldn’t leave yet.</p> <p>We found one of Billy’s vinyls that said in large green letters, <strong>NATURE’S MUSIC…RECORDED ON THIS PLANET</strong>, a field recording of a thunderstorm, and thought it would be funny to put it on while the real thunderstorm was flashing about outside. It was pretty funny for a while; we made gin &amp; tonics and walked around on the carpet. It was extra real. It was 3D. But then it suddenly became profane what we were doing, listening to a reproduction while the original storm had been given to us freely. It seemed terrible. The Grandfathers of the Lokota Sioux should have swooped down from the sky on their crimson steeds weilding lightning bolts in their fists! They should have spoken in terrible voices through their dog masks at us, <strong>DEFILERS! TAKE THAT VINYL AND SMASH IT ON THE CLIFF BELOW! YOU MUST NOT PROFANE THE THUNDERSTORM!</strong></p> <figure class="figure figure--right figure--vertical"><img class=figure__image width=432 height=640 src="../diaryland/assets/images/ludwig-koch-49699b08.jpg"/> <figcaption class=figure__caption>Ludwig Koch</figcaption></figure> <p>In other news, our house in Fishtown is haunted by a woman named Claire. UPS delievered a package here when nobody was home, and a woman named Claire signed for it who supposedly lives three doors to the left. But when we got back, <strong>THE PACKAGE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LIVING ROOM FLOOR</strong>. How could the package get in the house if the doors were locked? Claire. Further proof is found in an unusual occurance that both Mike and Billy have witnessed first hand concerning a borrowed yellow bicycle with a banana seat which sits in the living room. On two different occassions, the bicycle’s bell was heard ringing <strong>ALL BY ITSELF</strong> in the living room even though nobody else was home. How could the bicycle’s bell ring if nobody was in the living room? Claire. There have also been the sounds of screaming outside our windows, glass bottles flying through the air, and the sounds of babies crying somewhere far away, although we can hardly blame Claire for that; it’s just another day in Fishtown.</p> <p>My favorite thing that I frequently hear some lady yelling to her kids in the gravely, blown-out voice of an Eagles fan is: <strong>NO MORE STREET, YA HEAR ME! NO MORE STREET!</strong></p> <span class=article__dagger>◆</span> </article> </main> </body> </html>
