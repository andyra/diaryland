I lay prostrate in bed, farting quietly into the sleeping bag and watching spiders float in transverse waves over the compost pile when I found myself plodding down a road of unhappy thinking. So I rose, shampoo’d, and chased Henry throughout the great backyard with a bowl of apple’n’oatmeal in my hand. Henry reared on his hind legs and swung a branch in his mouth around like a quarterstaff, appearing at the same time like a horse and its rider.</p> <figure class="figure figure--left"><img class=figure__image width=800 height=800 src="/diaryland/assets/images/craft-show-fc784728.jpg"/></figure> <p>On the way to Cherrywood, a plastic yard sign pointed towards a craft fair held at the autumnal Presbyterian church, set in ledgestone, just over there, at the top of a grassy slope. I approached. Upon entry, a silvery old woman in an applique vest cooed sweet greetings to me, her eyes just visible between a display of plastic wreaths. I approached. She pointed out some of her wares: salad spoons and soaps coddled in linen drawstring bags. She gestured grandly towards a folding table on the far side of the room, creaking under the bounty of a hundred denim-clad church lady–hours: hard cookies, monkey bread, pumpkin rolls, styrofoam coffee, blintzes, puffs, and wheels. I approached. A genteel big-haired woman from Lago Vista woo’d me to her table with ornate descriptions of her scented candles. She explained she was more of a musk lady than a floral one. Couldn’t stand the scent of Jasmine. I liked Rocky Mountain Christmas and told her so. Handed her some money. Went on my way.</p> <p>Here are the names of all the available WiFi networks as I sit here at this peeling picnic table:</p> <ul class=list--pretty> <li>belkin.2.4</li> <li>All Hail Our Dark Father Satan</li> <li>Leia is LITERALLY Hitler</li> <li>Rock Hard Vagina</li> <li>that’s rich</li> <li>So Fresh So Clean</li> <li>Netgear78</li> <li>Netgear46</li> <li>veronicas equinox</li> <li>Sopping Wet Balls</li> <li>TWCWiFi</li> <li>thatsacuteweiner</li> </ul> <span class=article__dagger>◆</span> </article> </main> </body> </html>
