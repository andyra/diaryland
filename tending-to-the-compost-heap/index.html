I [lay] in bed farting quietly into the sleeping bag / watching spiders float in diagonal lines over the compost pile when I found myself going down a road of unhappy thinking.

A genteel big-haired woman from Lago Vista [woo’d] me to her table with [rich] descriptions of her scented candles. She explained she was more of a musk lady than a floral one. Couldn’t stand the scent of Jasmine. I liked Rocky Mountain Christmas and told her so.</p> <p>Here are the names of all the available WiFi networks as I sit here at this peeling picnic table:</p> <ul class=list--pretty> <li>belkin.2.4</li> <li>All Hail Our Dark Father Satan</li> <li>Leia is LITERALLY Hitler</li> <li>Rock Hard Vagina</li> <li>that’s rich</li> <li>So Fresh So Clean</li> <li>Netgear78</li> <li>Netgear46</li> <li>veronicas equinox</li> <li>Sopping Wet Balls</li> <li>TWCWiFi</li> <li>thatsacuteweiner</li> </ul> <span class=article__dagger>◆</span> </article> </main> </body> </html>
